## Directed Graph Representation

## Problem  
  Use adjacency-lists representation to represent a diagraph
  
## Problem Description 
  
## Solution
   The adjacency-lists representation is achieved by an array of adjacency lists (stack in this code), where we maintain a vertex-indexed array of stacks of the vertices adjacent to each vertex. In the adjacency-lists representation of an undirected graph, if v is on w’s list, then w will be on v’s list; the adjacency-lists representation of a digraph has no such symmetry.
