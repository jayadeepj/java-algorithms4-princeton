## Graph Representation

## Problem
  
  Use adjacency-lists representation to represent a graph
  
## Problem Description 
  
## Solution
   The adjacency-lists representation is achieved by an array of adjacency lists (stack in this code), where we maintain a vertex-indexed array of stacks of the vertices adjacent to each vertex.

##Dependencies 
 The stdlib.jar @ http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/ is used as dependency
