## Cycle Detection in Undirected Graph

## Problem
  
  Is a given graph acyclic?. Use adjacency-lists representation to represent a graph
  
## Problem Description 
  
## Solution
   U depth-first search to determine whether a graph has a cycle, and if so return one. It takes time proportional to V + E in the worst case.

##Dependencies 
 The stdlib.jar @ http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/ is used as dependency     
 
## Output 

 Graph Created with  13  vertices &  13 Edges    
 #   
 Checking Cycle ....    
 The node set with cycle is .. { 5 3 4 5}
