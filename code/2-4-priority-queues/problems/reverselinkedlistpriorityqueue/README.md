## Max Priority Queue by Reverse Linked List

## Problem 
 Priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.Implement a Priority Queue data structure by using a reverse ordered Linked List


## Problem Description 

 1. if the user enters a correct value , it should be enqueued to the Priority Queue. 
 2. if the user enters a "@" , the maximum value should be dequeued.
 3. if the user enters a "!" , the Priority Queue size should be returned.
 4. if the user enters a "*" , the Priority Queue should dequeue & return all the values using foreach.



##Dependencies 
 
 The stdlib.jar @ http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/ is used as dependency
