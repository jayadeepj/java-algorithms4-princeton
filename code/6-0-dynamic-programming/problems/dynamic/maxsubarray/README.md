# Max Sub Array Problem By DP


## Problem 

 Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
 For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
 the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

## Problem Description 

## Solution

 We use two max, maxSoFar -> max sub array found so far and maxEndingHere -> maximum sub array size that ends in this index. This is in place solution and time Complexity is O(N).
